## Tax Calculator System
## Problem Statement

Our project's main goal is to create a thorough tax calculating system specifically designed for American citizens and companies doing business in the United States. This technology is designed to accurately determine users' tax obligations while taking into consideration their unique income profiles and financial situations, as well as their geographical location. Our goal is to provide a user-friendly and effective solution to simplify the frequently complex chore of calculating tax liabilities.

## Project Scope

The core functionality of our system revolves around the precise calculation of federal and state income taxes. Users will receive accurate tax assessments by inputting their income sources and financial details.

We recognize the complexity of tax laws can differ significantly from one state to another. Our system will address this challenge by considering the distinctive tax rules and rates applicable in each state. Users will be able to calculate both federal and state taxes as accurately as possible, and the system will also take into account the state where the user resides.

In terms of the technologies, we will develop our idea primarily using Python. To keep our tax calculations up-to-date with the latest tax law changes, we will consult the IRS API.

## Project Justification

The US tax system is known for its complexity, and many individuals and businesses struggle with accurate tax calculations. Our project aims to simplify this process, making it easier for users to understand their tax obligations.

Users can save time and money by using our platform to calculate their taxes accurately, reducing the need for expensive tax advisors. On the other hand, it will be accessible to a wide range of users regardless of their tax knowledge, and therefore, it will be possible to lower the chance of mistakes in tax filings, which results in fewer fines for users.

## Roles

- **Planner - Jimena:** The goal of the planner is to organize the phases of the project, and outline how the code will be used and implemented. It will also be in charge of writing purpose statements for the users to view before use of the system.

- **Developer - Henry:** The developer takes the outline from the planner and develops the program. The program will be tweaked to accommodate user needs as plans may be subject to change as development begins.

- **Tester/Organizer - Carla:** The tester/organizer analyzes the program and suggests possible changes or any significant issues to the development. Also, the tester makes sure that the program addresses all of the guidelines given by the planner and finalizes the project (whatever is needed to make the project presentable).
