## Problem Statement
Our project's main goal is to create a thorough tax calculating system specifically designed
for American citizens and companies doing business there. This technology is made to
accurately determine users' tax obligations while taking into consideration their unique
income profiles and financial situations as well as geographical location. Our goal is to
provide a user-friendly and effective solution to approach the tax system in a more
undemanding way, making the frequently complex chore of calculating tax liabilities simpler.

## Project Scope
The core functionality of our system revolves around the precise calculation of federal and
state income taxes. By inputting their income sources and financial details, users will receive
accurate tax assessments.
We recognize the complexity of tax laws can differ significantly from one state to another.
Our system will address this challenge by considering the distinctive tax rules and rates
applicable in each state. Users will be able to calculate both federal and state taxes as
accurately as possible, and the system will also take into account the state where the user
invoices.
In terms of the technologies we will develop our idea primarily using Python, on the other
hand, in order to keep our tax calculations up-to-date with the latest tax law changes we will
consult the IRS API.

## Project Justification
The US tax system is known for its complexity, and many individuals and businesses struggle
with accurate tax calculations. Our project aims to simplify this process, making it easier for
users to understand their tax obligations.
Users can save time and money by using our platform to calculate their taxes accurately,
reducing the need for expensive tax advisors among others as we talked in class. On the other
hand, it will be accessible to a wide range of users regardless of tax knowledge, and
therefore, it will be possible to lower the chance of mistakes in tax filings, which results in
fewer fines for users.

## Roles
Planner - Jimena
The goal of the planner is to organize the phases of the project, outline how code will be used
and implemented, and will also be in charge of writing purpose-statements for the users to
view prior to use of the system.
Developer - Henry
The developer takes the outline from the planner and develops the program. The program will
be tweaked to accommodate user needs as plans may be subject to change as development
begins.
Tester/Organizer - Carla
The tester/organizer analyzes the program and suggests possible changes or any significant
issues to the development. Also the tester makes sure that the program addresses all of the
guidelines given by the planner and finalizes the project (whatever is needed to make the
project presentable).
