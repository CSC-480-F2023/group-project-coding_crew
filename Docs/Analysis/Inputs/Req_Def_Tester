## Stakeholder Personas

### Persona 1: End User - Rowan Everett

Rowan, a tech-savvy freelance consultant handling clients across multiple states, lacks in-depth knowledge of tax laws. 
She values a user-friendly system that assists her in accurately calculating taxes without the need for extensive financial expertise.

**Impact on Requirement:**
Rowan stands to benefit significantly from a comprehensive error reporting system, as it ensures that any mistakes in her 
input are easily identifiable and correctable. This aligns with her preference for a user-friendly tax calculation experience.

### Persona 2: Tester/Organizer - Carla LÃ³pez

**Background:**
Carla is tasked with analyzing the program and ensuring it adheres to guidelines. She seeks to streamline the testing
process and requires robust error reporting functionalities to identify potential issues during the development phase.
We don't want the user to put the data in and get the wrong output. Specially because a mistake like this can result in 
big fines and the lost of a valuable user

**Impact on Requirement:**
A comprehensive error reporting system will enhance Carla's efficiency in testing and organizing tasks. It will enable her 
to provide valuable feedback to the development team, contributing to the overall improvement of the tax calculating system.

## Constraints
