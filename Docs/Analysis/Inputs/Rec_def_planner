User Stories:

1. As a possible future user who might possess diverse income sources and financial intricacies, I desire an intuitive interface that 
allows me to input comprehensive financial details. This enables the system to furnish accurate federal and state tax assessments 
tailored to my specific financial situation.

   Rationale: Users with complex financial portfolios require a user-friendly interface to input detailed financial information. 
   The system's capability to process this information is crucial in providing accurate tax assessments.

2. As any user, I seek assurance that the system accounts for the unique tax rules and rates applicable in each state. This ensures 
that the calculated state taxes align with the nuanced tax laws of my jurisdiction.

   Rationale: The variation in tax laws among states necessitates the system's adaptability to ensure compliance and accuracy 
   in state tax calculations.

3. As any user, I anticipate the system to seamlessly integrate with the IRS API, ensuring real-time updates to reflect the latest 
changes in federal tax laws. This integration is crucial for staying abreast of regulatory modifications.

   Rationale: The dynamic nature of tax laws requires the system to maintain synchronization with the IRS API, guaranteeing accuracy 
   and compliance with the most recent federal tax regulations. The system must be constantly updating all new laws that may apply
   to users.

4. As a user, I appreciate clear and detailed purpose statements that guide me through the process of inputting financial 
information and understanding the calculated tax assessments. This ensures transparency and empowers users with a deeper 
understanding of their tax liability.

   Rationale: Clarity in purpose statements enhances user comprehension, fostering trust in the system's functionality and 
   promoting informed decision-making.

5. As a planner overseeing project development, I advocate for the implementation of the code in Python. Using Python's 
capabilities will enhance the efficiency, readability, and maintainability of the codebase.

   Rationale: Python's versatility and readability make it an ideal choice for the development of a complex system, promoting
   code maintainability and ease of collaboration within the development team.

6. As a planner, I emphasize the importance of defining and adhering to coding standards. Consistent and high-quality code 
enhances readability, reduces errors, and facilitates seamless collaboration among team members.

   Rationale: Coding standards are essential for maintaining a cohesive and reliable codebase, contributing to the long-term 
   sustainability of the project.

7. As a planner, I envision mechanisms for easy correction of errors within the system. This ensures prompt resolution of issues
during or after deployment, contributing to the overall robustness and reliability of the tax calculation system.

   Rationale: Anticipating and addressing potential errors is crucial for system reliability, user satisfaction, and maintaining
   the integrity of tax calculations.

8. As a planner, I stress the importance of thorough testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance tests. 
Rigorous testing ensures the reliability and accuracy of the tax calculation system, safeguarding against potential issues.

    Rationale: Comprehensive testing is essential for validating the system's functionality, identifying and addressing potential
    issues, and ensuring a seamless user experience.

To effectively manage the development of our tax calculation system, a structured and organized approach to documenting 
and sharing project artifacts is paramount. As such, the project repository will serve as a centralized hub for critical documents 
and files. The following requirements are identified for seamless collaboration and knowledge sharing within the development team:

1. Requirements for the group project repository
   - Functional Requirement: As a fundamental necessity, the project repository should facilitate the upload of various documents 
   outlining user stories, technical specifications, and system functionalities. This requirement ensures that the team has easy 
   access to the evolving project requirements.

2. Stakeholder personas that are impacted/relevant to your requirement
   - Functional Requirement: The repository should support the upload and categorization of stakeholder personas. This includes
   detailed profiles of users, acquirers, producers, and regulators who play a role in or are impacted by the tax calculation system.
   This requirement aids in aligning development efforts with stakeholder needs.

3. Constraints relevant to your requirement
   - Functional Requirement: The repository should allow the upload of documents outlining constraints that may affect the project,
   such as technological limitations, budgetary constraints, or time constraints. This ensures that the team is aware of and can 
   actively manage these constraints during the development process.

4. Correctly categorize requirements and stakeholders 
   - Functional Requirement: The repository should provide a structured system for categorizing requirements as either functional
   or non-functional. Additionally, stakeholders should be categorized into user, acquirer, producer, or regulator roles. This ensures
   that development efforts are aligned with the appropriate stakeholders and that both functional and non-functional aspects are 
   adequately addressed.

   - Non-Functional Requirement: The categorization feature should be intuitive and user-friendly, promoting ease of use for team
   members contributing to the repository. This non-functional requirement emphasizes the importance of usability and accessibility
   in the repository's design.
